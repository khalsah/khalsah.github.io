      Hi, my name is Hargobind Khalsa.
      I currently work as a developer at <a href="http://raptmedia.com">Rapt Media</a> where I build awesome software for interactive video.
    </p>

    <p>
      My recent work has focused on web applications built with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> as well as a nice helping of Javascript in the form of <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>.
      I am a huge fan of Ruby, the Web, and its associated technologies, but my interests don't stop there.
      I enjoy algorithms and data structures and would love to write an operating system someday, just for fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the off chance that someone has managed to pry me away from a computer you are likely to find me discussing math (or its applications) with friends, drinking coffee, playing board games, or most likely some combination thereof.
    </p>
